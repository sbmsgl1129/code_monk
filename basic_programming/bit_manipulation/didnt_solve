1. MYSTERY - num of 1's in their binary representation
2. Subham and Binary Strings - no of 0's - i would just go over string and do the count. Not sure what is
                                           editorial of it. maybe take input in binary form and count num 0's
3. Monk and the box of cookies - for all integers find which poitions bit is set. Increment that count in
                                 an array which keeps a counter. The index with the highest counter wins
4. The Castle Gate - simple O(n^2) XOR's and check. There may be more interesting solution but I am not
                     interested in it.
5. Jarvis and Lone Integer - Classic XOR
6. Subset AND - if at the positions of 1 in Z, if we have zeros in the array, then our work is done 
7. Rajan and Odd frequency number  - Simple XOR
8. lazy hash - number of 1's set
9. Special Bit Numbers - Simple parse and pre-processing will help
10. Micro and Binary Strings - Count no of ones
11.
